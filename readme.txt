This repository contains all of the files needed to calculate AM and associated quantities for xGASS, to create our public catalogue.
This is done in stages; therefore, the files need to be run in the following order:
 - 1_ExtractFromDecompCatalogue.ipynb
 - 2_BuildingProfiles_of_xGASS.ipynb
 - 3_AM_calculations.ipynb
 - Calculating_fatm_q.ipynb
 - WritingPublicCatalogue.ipynb
